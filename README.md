Run-Length Encoding Program

Description: 

This program performs Run-Length Encoding (RLE) on input text files. 
It can both encode plaintext files and decode RLE-encoded files.

Features 
Encoding: Converts input text into its RLE-encoded form.

Decoding: Converts RLE-encoded text back into its original form.

Input/Output Files:
Reads input from input.txt and writes output to output.txt.

User Interaction: 
Allows the user to choose between encoding and decoding.

Compile:
Compile the source code using your C++ compiler.

Run the Program: Execute the compiled binary.
Usage

Input: 
Write the text you want to encode or the RLE-encoded text you want to decode in input.txt.

Choose Operation: 
Run the program and choose whether you want to encode or decode.

Output: 
The result will be written to output.txt.

Example

Suppose input.txt contains the following text:

"hello my name is Kyial"

If you choose to encode, 
the resulting output.txt will contain:

"h1e1l2o1 1m1y1 1n1a1m1e1 1i1s1 1K1y1i1a1l1"

If you choose to decode the above encoded text, 
the resulting output.txt will contain:

"hello my name is Kyial"
